# django-admin-fk-links
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django-admin-fk-links.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/django-admin-fk-links/)

Reusable Django admin mixin that turns `ForeignKey` fields into direct clickable links to their related admin change views.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Converts `ForeignKey` fields into clickable links in `list_display`
- ✅ Works with the default Django admin and custom `AdminSite`
- ✅ Zero configuration
- ✅ No need to add to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- ✅ Fully compatible with Django 2.2+
<!-- - ✅ Tested with `pytest` and `pytest-django` -->

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install django-admin-fk-links
```

## 🚀 Quick Usage
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django_admin_fk_links import ForeignKeyLinkMixin

@admin.register(Book)
class BookAdmin(ForeignKeyLinkMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ("title", "author")
    list_display_foreign_key_links = ("author",)
```
That’s it.
The author column will now be a direct link to its admin change view.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
The mixin dynamically replaces the fields listed in:
```python
list_display_foreign_key_links = ("field_name",)
```

with callables that render an <a> tag pointing to the related object’s admin change view.

It also supports:
- Sorting via admin_order_field
- Automatic verbose_name resolution
- Custom AdminSite namespaces

---
## ✅ Compatibility
- Django 2.2+
- Python 3.7+
- Default admin.site ✅
- Custom AdminSite(name="custom") ✅
